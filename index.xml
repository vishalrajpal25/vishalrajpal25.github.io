      <description>Pythonic Programming PEP20 - The zen of python https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/
Tuples Tuple is immutable, list is a mutable. Unpacking a tuple Use * for unpacking for function arguments
Sorting functions
Lambda functions Short cut function definition, useful for functions used only in one place, frequently passed as parameters to other functions. Also, referred to as callbacks.
List comprehensions [x for x in list] It is a python idiom that creates a shortcut for a for loop.</description>

      <description>Day 2 Note for missing two days - Daddy hurt his eye while playing badminton with his friends. Hence, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t blog.
We had school today morning and we learnt the alphabets - &amp;lsquo;H&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;. We also had a story time in the school&amp;rsquo;s session and we read a story about a cap-seller and a monkey.
We had story time with Dipna too (later in the day) and we learnt about snorkelling and sea creatures - eel, snakes and yellow fishes.</description>

      <description>Day 1 We are beginning our daily experiment to log our activities and learnings for the day together (Nevish, mommy and Daddy)
Nevish: I had (virtual) school this morning at 11 am. The class was moved to MS Teams platform today and it was a little noisy. Possibly, it was the transition but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as smooth as zoom. However, we started the class with praying and then we learnt answering questions like &amp;ldquo;What is my Name?</description>

      <description>Day 10 of tennis
Day 10 of formal tennis on June 17, 2020. Following learnings from today:
It was just an average play today. Got a chance to play rallies with a senior coach and realized that one is as good as one&amp;rsquo;s game.
  Loss of focus and technique: The alertness and awareness converts into caution causing unforced errors and miscalculations. The placement judgement dips and thus the quality of shots deteriorates.</description>

      <description>Day 8 of tennis
Day 8 of formal tennis on June 15, 2020. Following are the improvements from last week:
 Better judgement of the ball: The best position for a forehand or backhand is the max height of ball at the abdomen level provides ideal control and swing. The ball position with the right tilted face and lower to upper swing of the racquet generates the right momentum for the ball to cross the net.</description>

      <description>I got to learn about Cloud Native Computing Foundation as I was browsing through Helm. From CNCF website:
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) hosts critical components of the global technology infrastructure. CNCF brings together the world’s top developers, end users, and vendors and runs the largest open source developer conferences. CNCF is part of the nonprofit Linux Foundation.
It is also important to understand the meaning of cloud native computing and what the approach covers / recommends.</description>

      <description>Day 4 of tennis
Day 4 of formal tennis learning on June 8, 2020. While the first day gives you a lot of confidence as you start hitting the ball, it is not soon that you realize in the 3rd or 4th day the importance of technique in the game.
Below are the 4 key learnings that I got for a beginner level tennis player:
  Stance: The key element to understand both fore-hand and back-hand hitting in tennis is the stance or the body position wrt to the ball.</description>

      <description>Spark on YARN - Considerations and Configurations About Spark Apache Spark™ is a DAG based execution engine for large-scale data processing. It has in-memory processing capabilities making it faster as compared to other execution engines. Spark boasts ease of use and generality through native language support (R, Scala, Python, Java ) and SQL &amp;amp; streaming analytics respectively.
Spark on Yarn Spark runs on Hadoop (YARN), Mesos, standalone, or in the cloud.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning - Spark Over Mahout</title>

      <guid>https://vishalrajpal25.github.io/tech/spark_over_mahout_3/</guid>
      <description>Machine Learning - Spark Over Mahout I started my career writing code in Java. I definitely love the object oriented language and the GC support. I experienced the native side of Java while implementing few low latency high throughput applications at a financial institution. The power is immense.
As I started developing machine learning models in Hadoop, Apache Mahout was my straight forward choice since it was natively implemented in Java.</description>

      <description>Data, Model, Score, Decision - Time-to-market for Big Data Analytics One of the known challenges for Big data analytics has been the time-to-market OR production deployment of analytical models and solutions.
What does that mean: Organizations have multiple problems to solve which impact their bottom and top-line. Various analytical solutions (descriptive and predictive) are developed to optimize their operations. Once these solutions are ready to predict the best possible business outcomes, the next step is to operationalize them in a production environment.</description>

      <description>Big Data 2.016 - Practical implementation challenges We have all witnessed the journey of “Big data” from inception until 2015. Big data got a fair share of attention and has passed through the hype cycle. In 2016, there is a different set of challenges that organizations need to overcome for realizing the true potential of Big data through analytics. These challenges are primarily related to implementation of Big Data projects.</description>
