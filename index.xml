      <description>I got to learn about Cloud Native Computing Foundation as I was browsing through Helm. From CNCF website:
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) hosts critical components of the global technology infrastructure. CNCF brings together the world’s top developers, end users, and vendors and runs the largest open source developer conferences. CNCF is part of the nonprofit Linux Foundation.
It is also important to understand the meaning of cloud native computing and what the approach covers / recommends.</description>

      <description>I am at my fourth day of formal tennis learning on June 8, 2020. While the first day gives you a lot of confidence as you start hitting the ball, it is not soon that you realize in the 3rd or 4th day the importance of technique in the game.
Below are the 4 key learnings that I got for a beginner level tennis player:
  Stance: The key element to understand both fore-hand and back-hand hitting in tennis is the stance or the body position wrt to the ball.</description>

      <description>Spark on YARN - Considerations and Configurations About Spark Apache Spark™ is a DAG based execution engine for large-scale data processing. It has in-memory processing capabilities making it faster as compared to other execution engines. Spark boasts ease of use and generality through native language support (R, Scala, Python, Java ) and SQL &amp;amp; streaming analytics respectively.
Spark on Yarn Spark runs on Hadoop (YARN), Mesos, standalone, or in the cloud.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning - Spark Over Mahout</title>

      <description>Machine Learning - Spark Over Mahout I started my career writing code in Java. I definitely love the object oriented language and the GC support. I experienced the native side of Java while implementing few low latency high throughput applications at a financial institution. The power is immense.
As I started developing machine learning models in Hadoop, Apache Mahout was my straight forward choice since it was natively implemented in Java.</description>

      <description>Data, Model, Score, Decision - Time-to-market for Big Data Analytics One of the known challenges for Big data analytics has been the time-to-market OR production deployment of analytical models and solutions.
What does that mean: Organizations have multiple problems to solve which impact their bottom and top-line. Various analytical solutions (descriptive and predictive) are developed to optimize their operations. Once these solutions are ready to predict the best possible business outcomes, the next step is to operationalize them in a production environment.</description>
