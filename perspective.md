        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">What I've Learned</h2>

        <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr)); gap: 2rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            <div>
                <h4>On Enterprise AI</h4>
                <p>Integration matters more than models. Orchestration, observability, security, and compliance are the hard problems. Most companies need infrastructure and organizational design, not research.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>On MLOps at Scale</h4>
                <p>It's organizational design, not just technical architecture. Incentives, ownership, and workflows determine success more than tooling choices.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>On Cloud Modernization</h4>
                <p>Migration is the problem, not technology. Data gravity and organizational change management are the constraints. Tooling is solved.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>On Due Diligence</h4>
                <p>Pattern recognition. After enough systems, the same failure modes repeat: unrealistic GTM, team structure problems, technical debt that can't be paid down.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Investment Focus</h2>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Areas of interest:</p>

            <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li>Infrastructure that reduces time-to-production for AI systems</li>
                <li>Enterprise workflow automation with native integration</li>
                <li>Governance and compliance infrastructure for regulated environments</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="color: var(--text-secondary);">Less relevant: Model wrappers, consumer applications, unclear distribution strategy.</p>
        </div>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Work I Find Interesting</h2>

        <p>Enterprise AI products for regulated industries and complex workflows. Teams with production deployments and technical depth. Primarily Series A–C & select earlier stage with exceptional founders who understand enterprise software.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; color: var(--text-secondary);">Outside my focus: Consumer AI, research projects without clear commercialization path, teams without enterprise go-to-market experience.</p>
