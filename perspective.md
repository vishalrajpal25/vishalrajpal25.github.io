                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Background</h3>
                <p>VP Engineering at Fractal Analytics, leading Cogentiq—an enterprise agentic AI platform deployed at Fortune 500 companies.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">What I've Learned</h2>

        <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr)); gap: 2rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            <div>
                <h4>On Enterprise AI</h4>
                <p>Integration matters more than models. Orchestration, observability, security, and compliance are the hard problems. Most companies need infrastructure and organizational design, not research.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>On MLOps at Scale</h4>
                <p>It's organizational design, not just technical architecture. Incentives, ownership, and workflows determine success more than tooling choices.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>On Cloud Modernization</h4>
                <p>Migration is the problem, not technology. Data gravity and organizational change management are the constraints. Tooling is solved.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>On Due Diligence</h4>
                <p>Pattern recognition. After enough systems, the same failure modes repeat: unrealistic GTM, team structure problems, technical debt that can't be paid down.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">What's Investable</h2>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">I look for:</p>

            <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li>Tools that reduce time-to-production for AI systems</li>
                <li>Workflow automation that integrates with existing enterprise infrastructure</li>
                <li>Infrastructure with governance and compliance built in, not bolted on</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Not interested in:</strong> Model wrappers, consumer AI, "AI for X" without distribution.</p>
        </div>

        <hr class="divider">

        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">What I'm Looking For</h2>

        <p>Building real enterprise AI products for regulated industries or complex workflows. Teams that ship to production, not just demos. Series A–C, or exceptional pre-seed founders with enterprise software experience.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;"><strong>Not a fit:</strong> Consumer AI, pure research, unclear GTM, companies that don't understand enterprise procurement or security review processes.</p>
