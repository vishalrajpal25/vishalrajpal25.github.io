            <h3>How I Operate</h3>
            <p>
                I wear multiple hats: technical and engineering-driven, but I can market and sell. I'm a hustler based in the Bay Area with deep enterprise context. I can decipher noise and shiny objects clearly.
            </p>
            <p>
                CXOs and SVPs trust me because I don't sell hard—I base decisions on facts. Junior and senior engineers like working with me because I empathize. I'm humble, operate with high EQ, and have 360-degree experience across SVP, CTO, and product leadership roles.

            <h3>Enterprise AI Reality Check</h3>
            <p>
                Enterprise AI adoption succeeds through <strong>integration</strong>—orchestration, observability, and security matter more than any single model. Most companies need boring infrastructure and change management more than cutting-edge research.
            </p>
            <p>
                The gap between demo and production is organizational, not technical. The companies that win are the ones that understand procurement, security teams, and compliance requirements from day one.

            <h3>What's Actually Investable</h3>
            <p>I look for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tooling that reduces time-to-production.</strong> The faster you can take AI from experiment to deployed system, the more valuable you are.</li>
                <li><strong>Workflow automation that fits existing enterprise systems.</strong> Rip-and-replace doesn't work. Integration and gradual adoption do.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure that handles governance and compliance by default.</strong> Security and compliance can't be afterthoughts in regulated industries.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                Not interested in: more model wrappers, consumer AI plays, or "AI for X" without distribution strategy.

            <h3>Pattern Recognition</h3>
            <p>After operating across McKinsey (consulting), Databricks (product), and Fractal (enterprise deployment), I've seen the same architectural and team design traps repeat:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MLOps at scale is as much organizational design as technical architecture.</strong> You can't productionize ML without fixing incentives, ownership, and workflows.</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud data modernization is a migration problem, not just a tooling problem.</strong> The technology is solved. The challenge is organizational change management and data gravity.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical due diligence is pattern recognition.</strong> After enough systems, you see the same failure modes: technical debt, team structure problems, unrealistic GTM assumptions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What I'm Looking For</h3>
            <p>
                Companies building <strong>real enterprise AI products</strong>—regulated industries, complex workflows, 0→1 product challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Teams that value:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shipping over demos</li>
                <li>Enterprise buyers over hype cycles</li>
                <li>Sustainable business models over funding rounds</li>
                <li>Boring infrastructure over bleeding-edge research</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                <strong>Stage:</strong> Series A–C, or pre-seed with exceptional founders who have sold enterprise software before.

            <h3>What I'm NOT Looking For</h3>
            <p>
                Consumer AI, unregulated markets, pure research plays, companies that can't articulate their GTM.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've seen too many "AI platforms" die in enterprise procurement. If you don't understand why security teams say no, we're not aligned. If your demo-to-production timeline is measured in quarters, not weeks, we have a problem.

            <h3>My Range</h3>
            <p>
                I've operated across the full technology stack:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consulting:</strong> McKinsey (strategy), Fractal (client-driven transformation)</li>
                <li><strong>Product:</strong> Databricks (PaaS, subscription, enterprise sales model)</li>
                <li><strong>Platform Engineering:</strong> Cogentiq (build + deploy + scale at Fortune 500 companies)</li>
                <li><strong>GTM & Sales Engineering:</strong> Databricks partnerships, Fractal client transformation</li>
                <li><strong>People Leadership:</strong> 80+ engineering teams, cross-functional organizations</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                This range lets me evaluate companies across the full value chain: technology, business model, team, GTM, and organizational design.
