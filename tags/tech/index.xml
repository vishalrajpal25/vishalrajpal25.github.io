      <description>Spark on YARN - Considerations and Configurations About Spark Apache Spark™ is a DAG based execution engine for large-scale data processing. It has in-memory processing capabilities making it faster as compared to other execution engines. Spark boasts ease of use and generality through native language support (R, Scala, Python, Java ) and SQL &amp;amp; streaming analytics respectively.
Spark on Yarn Spark runs on Hadoop (YARN), Mesos, standalone, or in the cloud.</description>

      <description>Machine Learning - Spark Over Mahout I started my career writing code in Java. I definitely love the object oriented language and the GC support. I experienced the native side of Java while implementing few low latency high throughput applications at a financial institution. The power is immense.
As I started developing machine learning models in Hadoop, Apache Mahout was my straight forward choice since it was natively implemented in Java.</description>

      <description>Data, Model, Score, Decision - Time-to-market for Big Data Analytics One of the known challenges for Big data analytics has been the time-to-market OR production deployment of analytical models and solutions.
What does that mean: Organizations have multiple problems to solve which impact their bottom and top-line. Various analytical solutions (descriptive and predictive) are developed to optimize their operations. Once these solutions are ready to predict the best possible business outcomes, the next step is to operationalize them in a production environment.</description>
