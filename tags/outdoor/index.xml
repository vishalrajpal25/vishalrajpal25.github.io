Day 10 of formal tennis on June 17, 2020. Following learnings from today:

      <description>Day 4 of tennis
Day 4 of formal tennis learning on June 8, 2020. While the first day gives you a lot of confidence as you start hitting the ball, it is not soon that you realize in the 3rd or 4th day the importance of technique in the game.
