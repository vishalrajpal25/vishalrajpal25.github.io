      <description>Day 2 Note for missing two days - Daddy hurt his eye while playing badminton with his friends. Hence, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t blog.
We had school today morning and we learnt the alphabets - &amp;lsquo;H&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;. We also had a story time in the school&amp;rsquo;s session and we read a story about a cap-seller and a monkey.
We had story time with Dipna too (later in the day) and we learnt about snorkelling and sea creatures - eel, snakes and yellow fishes.</description>

      <description>Day 1 We are beginning our daily experiment to log our activities and learnings for the day together (Nevish, mommy and Daddy)
Nevish: I had (virtual) school this morning at 11 am. The class was moved to MS Teams platform today and it was a little noisy. Possibly, it was the transition but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as smooth as zoom. However, we started the class with praying and then we learnt answering questions like &amp;ldquo;What is my Name?</description>
