      <description>Day 1 We are beginning our daily experiment to log our activities and learnings for the day together (Nevish, mommy and Daddy)
Nevish: I had (virtual) school this morning at 11 am. The class was moved to MS Teams platform today and it was a little noisy. Possibly, it was the transition but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as smooth as zoom. However, we started the class with praying and then we learnt answering questions like &amp;ldquo;What is my Name?</description>

      <description>Day 10 of tennis
Day 10 of formal tennis on June 17, 2020. Following learnings from today:
It was just an average play today. Got a chance to play rallies with a senior coach and realized that one is as good as one&amp;rsquo;s game.
  Loss of focus and technique: The alertness and awareness converts into caution causing unforced errors and miscalculations. The placement judgement dips and thus the quality of shots deteriorates.</description>

      <description>Day 8 of tennis
Day 8 of formal tennis on June 15, 2020. Following are the improvements from last week:
 Better judgement of the ball: The best position for a forehand or backhand is the max height of ball at the abdomen level provides ideal control and swing. The ball position with the right tilted face and lower to upper swing of the racquet generates the right momentum for the ball to cross the net.</description>

      <description>Day 4 of tennis
Day 4 of formal tennis learning on June 8, 2020. While the first day gives you a lot of confidence as you start hitting the ball, it is not soon that you realize in the 3rd or 4th day the importance of technique in the game.
Below are the 4 key learnings that I got for a beginner level tennis player:
  Stance: The key element to understand both fore-hand and back-hand hitting in tennis is the stance or the body position wrt to the ball.</description>
