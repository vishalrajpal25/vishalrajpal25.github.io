      <description>Day 1 We are beginning our daily experiment to log our activities and learnings for the day together (Nevish, mommy and Daddy)
Nevish: I had (virtual) school this morning at 11 am. The class was moved to MS Teams platform today and it was a little noisy. Possibly, it was the transition but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as smooth as zoom. However, we started the class with praying and then we learnt answering questions like &amp;ldquo;What is my Name?</description>
